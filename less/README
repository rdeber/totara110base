To update theme CSS, you must set up and run a totara-specific grunt process.

1. Install npm locally `npm install -g grunt-cli`
2. Run npm setup for totara:
    cd totarawwwroot
    npm install
3. Run grunt process within theme directory:
    cd theme/themename
    grunt css
4. If changes are made to the files in less/colors Update the css files by changing to
   the theme/themename directory and running
    ls less/colors/*less | sed 's/.less//g' | awk -F/ '{ print "lessc less/colors/"$NF".less style/"$NF"-noprocess.css" }' | bash
